ASTEROID INVADER
===================

This is the base game for the Android game [Asteroid Invader]. The original game use a framework that handles UI, character selection, IAP, Ads, leaderboards, etc, coded by me and designed by a colleague. The game has been stripped from that framework and only the base game is available to the public.

The purpose of this repository is to exhibit the code of the game.
